# "What's a..." infographics.


What's a Supernova? What's a Star? What's a blackhole?

Those are cool questions with cool answers. One of the best way to explain complex concepts with through effective visual design. The "What's a.." project is to create simple infographics for public engagement and outreach purposes. 

## Resources 

### Completed infographics

* What's a White Dwarf? (SVG, PDF, PNG)
* What's a Star? (SVG, PDF, PNG)
* What's a Supernova? (SVG, PDF, PNG)

### Individual illustrations
These are designs and illustrations I made for the infographics that I thought may be useful again at a later date so I put them in individual files.
You can also access these and use them or modify them for your own projects.

* Accretion onto white dwarf (SVG)
* Core collapse (SVG)
* Earth (SVG)
* Galaxy (SVG)
* Gravitational Waves (SVG)
* Hydrogen Fusion (SGV)
* Illustrations Ca, Fe, H2O (SVG)
* One spoonfull, one tonne (SVG)
* Planetary nebula (SVG)
* SN lightcurve (SVG)
* Stars (SVG)
* White dwarf layers (SVG)


## Using these resources

Each infographic comes in `.pdf` and `.svg` format as well as `.png`. You can use the PDF as is or extracts particular elements from the SVG file easily by opening in a vector graphics editor. **You don't need anything fancy!** All these designs where created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) which is completely free! From Inkscape you can modify these designs to fit your needs... which brings me onto the most important things here:

I hope that what I'm going to put here will be useful. Feel free to get in touch (see below) if you have any requests or suggestions!

## Upcoming work

I've got some plans as to what I want to create in the future:
 - "What's a Black Hole?"
 - "What's a Core Collapse Supernova?"
 - "What's a Thermonuclear Supernova?"
 - "What's a Pulsar?"
 - "What's Gravitational Waves?"
