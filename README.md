# "What's a..." Sci-fographics.

Short for Science infographics.

What's a Supernova? What's a Star? What's a blackhole?

Those are cool questions with cool answers. One of the best way to explain complex concepts with through effective visual design. The "What's a.." project is to create simple infographics for public engagement and outreach purposes. 

## Using these resources

Each infographic comes in `.pdf` and `.svg` format. You can use the PDF as is or extracts particular elements from the SVG file easily by opening in a vector graphics editor. **You don't need anything fancy!** All these designs where created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) which is completely free! From Inkscape you can modify these designs to fit your needs... which brings me onto the most important things here:

 - "What's a Black Hole?"
 - "What's a Core Collapse Supernova?"
 - "What's a Thermonuclear Supernova?"
 - "What's a Star?"
